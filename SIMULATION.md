# Simulation Documentation

This file documents the SDLC simulation test that was run to validate the Autonomous Engineering OS framework.

## Goal

Run a full end-to-end SDLC simulation to prove the framework works before real product development begins.

## Scenario

"Add a fake feature: an API endpoint /health that returns { status: 'ok' }"

## Context

- GitHub Projects SDLC Board: https://github.com/users/ranjan-expatready/projects/2
- Automation Rules: SDLC_AUTOMATION_VERIFICATION.md
- Framework Status: 100% complete in SSOT

## Simulation Steps

1. ✅ Create Issue #17 with PRD + acceptance criteria
2. ✅ Issue appears on SDLC board
3. ✅ Assign Issue → triggers automation Rule 2
4. ✅ Create PLAN artifact
5. ✅ Implement feature (FastAPI /health endpoint)
6. ✅ Create PR #18 with link to Issue
7. ⏳ Machine Board validation (in progress)
8. ⏸️ Request review / QA review (pending)
9. ⏸️ Approval gate (pending)
10. ⏸️ Merge PR (pending)
11. ⏸️ Update STATUS_LEDGER (pending)
12. ⏸️ Create VERIFICATION artifact (pending)
13. ⏸️ Run resume protocol (pending)
14. ⏸️ Collect evidence (pending)
